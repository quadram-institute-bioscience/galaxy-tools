description: Improving the consensus accuracy in genome assemblies produced from long high error sequencing data
long_description: |
  POLCA is a polishing tool aimed at improving the consensus accuracy in genome assemblies produced from long high error sequencing data generated by PacBio SMRT or Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies. POLCA utilizes Illumina or PacBio HIFI reads for the same genome for improving the consensus quality of the assembly. Its inputs are the genome sequence and a fasta or fastq file (or files) of Illumina or PacBioHIFI reads and its outputs are the polished genome and a VCF file with the variants called from the read data
